    "The PPG measures blood flow at the wrist. The LEDs in a PPG sensor shine a typically green light into your skin and your red blood cells absorb that green light. The reflected light is then measured by the photodetector. When your heart beats and blood perfuses through the wrist, there are more red blood cells that absorb the green light and the photodetector sees a smaller signal. As the heart fills back up with blood and blood leaves your wrist, the more green light is reflected back and the photodetector reading goes up. This oscillating waveform can be used to detect pulse rate. \n",
